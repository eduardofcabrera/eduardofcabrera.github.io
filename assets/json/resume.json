During this time, I was involved in the development of a project for Petrobras for a deep learning system to detect faults in systems on its oil platforms. My main tasks were developing and applying a deep learning model using recurrent neural networks and graph neural networks, as well as developing software with performance and memory requirements. As a result, I was able to develop a solid knowledge of many deep learning techniques as well as learning the main frameworks for developing AI systems such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.","highlights":["Research","Deep Learning","Adaptive Learning","Machine Learning","Statistics","Linux"]},{"name":"Rocket Chat (Remote)","position":"Summer Intern","url":"https://www.rocket.chat/open-source-communications-platform?utm_device=c&utm_term=rocket%20chat&utm_campaign=brand_sr_br_generic&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=7547430168&hsa_cam=15850668853&hsa_grp=130981703023&hsa_ad=575426984803&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-314268247829&hsa_kw=rocket%20chat&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA3aeqBhBzEiwAxFiOBr0X3XtkZOY8O4zMkjUdTKIYHz-bs2uzBKLYe6LCozkHtr8V2aJ0ZBoCJ_wQAvD_BwE","startDate":"2022-01","endDate":"2022-04","summary":"In the summer of 2022, I interned for 2 months at Startup Rocket.Chat, a chat service provider for team collaboration. During this period I was able to insert myself in an innovation ecosystem and help in the development of the web system using Javascript, Typescript and MongoDB. Among my functions, the main ones were: developing endpoints, building new features and correcting any errors in the system. Also, Rocket.Chat is an international company, so I got an experience of daily communication in English and contact with people from all over the world.","highlights":["Back-End Web Development","Typescript","JavaScript"]}],"volunteer":[],"education":[{"institution":"Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo","url":"https://www5.usp.br/","area":"Electrical Engineering","studyType":"Bachelor","startDate":"2020-01","endDate":"Present","score":"8.7 GPA"}],"awards":[{"title":"Best Paper Award in BRACIS 2023","date":"2023","awarder":"BRACIS (Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems)"}],"certificates":[],"publications":[],"skills":[],"languages":[{"language":"Portuguese","fluency":"Native speaker"},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent"},{"language":"French","fluency":"Intermediary"}],"interests":[],"references":[],"projects":[]}
