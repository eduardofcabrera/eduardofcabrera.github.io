      "summary": "For over a year I worked as a research intern in artificial intelligence at the Laboratory of Intelligent Techniques at USP's Polytechnic School in conjunction with the Numerical Test Tank. During this time, I was involved in the development of a project for Petrobras for a deep learning system to detect faults in systems on its oil platforms. My main tasks were developing and applying a deep learning model using recurrent neural networks and graph neural networks, as well as developing software with performance and memory requirements. As a result, I was able to develop a solid knowledge of many deep learning techniques as well as learning the main frameworks for developing AI systems such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.",

During this period I was able to insert myself in an innovation ecosystem and help in the development of the web system using Javascript, Typescript and MongoDB. Among my functions, the main ones were: developing endpoints, building new features and correcting any errors in the system. Also, Rocket.Chat is an international company, so I got an experience of daily communication in English and contact with people from all over the world.",
